## 🧭 Professional Journey Section Enhancements

1. **Clickable Links**:
    - Make the organization names clickable:
        - **BCIT** → https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-information-technology-diploma-full-time-5540dipma/
        - **Stratford Hall** → https://www.stratfordhall.ca/
2. **Logos / Icons**:
    - Move organization image to the **left side of each entry**, next to the organization name.
    - If no logo image is provided manually, **fallback to the website’s favicon** using the provided URL.
        - Example: auto-fetch favicon for `https://www.bcit.ca/`
3. **Hover Animation**:
    - When hovering over a journey entry:
        - Add a subtle **scale-up animation** (slightly increase size on hover).
        - Make it smooth, lightweight, and consistent.

## 🚀 Featured Projects Section

- Add interactive hover effects:
    - On hover, each project card should **scale slightly larger**.
    - Add **a dynamic animation** (like shadow/tilt, parallax, or subtle pop effect).
    - Maintain performance on mobile — avoid heavy JS or large-scale effects.
