Hi Replit, Under no circumstance, make a checkpoint until you are finished all requirements and double checked each update works from the prompts! Please implement the following visual and interaction enhancements. Once they’re applied, **add clear, inline comments and update the README section** explaining **how to adjust these features manually** for future updates.

---

## 🖼️ Main Profile Photo – Hover Animation

- Add a **hover animation** to the **main profile photo**:
    - Subtle **scale-up**, **glow**, or soft **transition effect**.
    - The effect should be smooth and professional.
- ✅ After implementing:
    - Add comments or documentation showing **how to adjust** the animation timing, easing, or scale factor.

---

## 🌘 Dark Mode – Hover Shadows

- For all hoverable elements with animations, in **dark mode**:
    - Add a **soft shadow or glow** effect using the **secondary brand color**: `#F1D2E7`.
    - This helps differentiate interactivity visually without being overpowering.
- ✅ After implementing:
    - Document where the shadow color/style is defined (e.g., Tailwind class, custom CSS, or component style).
    - Explain **how to change the color, blur radius, or opacity** if needed.

## ⚙️ Technical Skills Cards – Shine Effect

- When a user **hovers over a technical skill card**, add a **quick, subtle shine effect**:
    - For example: a diagonal shimmer or gradient swipe using `@keyframes`, `clip-path`, or `::before` pseudo-elements.
    - The effect should reset cleanly and look good in both light and dark mode.
- ✅ After implementing:
    - Include instructions or comments on how to change the direction, speed, or style of the shine effect.

## 🧭 Spotlight Cursor Tracker – Adjustment

- The current cursor spotlight is still **offset to the bottom right**.
- Please update the effect so the **spotlight is centered directly under the mouse cursor**.
    - If using CSS or JS-based coordinates (`event.clientX`, `event.clientY`), ensure proper translation.
- ✅ After fixing:
    - Add a short note explaining:
        - How the effect works
        - Where the spotlight size, blur, and position offset can be adjusted
        - How to disable or style it further if needed

📚 Please ensure all new features are:

- **Commented inline**
- Included in a `README.md` section titled `🔧 Customizing Visual Effects`

This will help future updates be accessible and editable, even for beginners. Thank you!
