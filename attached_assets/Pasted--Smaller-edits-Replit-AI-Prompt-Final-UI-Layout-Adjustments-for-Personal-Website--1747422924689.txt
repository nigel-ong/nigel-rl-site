    ### Replit AI Prompt: Final UI & Layout Adjustments for Personal Website
    
    Hi Replit, I need help polishing the final layout and UI responsiveness of my GitHub Pages-compatible personal website. Do not make a checkpoint until you are finished all requirements in the prompts and verified it works as intended. Please apply the following updates:
    
    ---
    
    ## üß≠ Layout & Section Order
    
    - **Move the Technical Skills section above Projects.**
        
        (i.e., section order: About ‚Üí Journey ‚Üí Skills ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Contact)
        
    
    ---
    
    ## üì¨ Contact Section (Ref: Screenshot)
    
    - Make the **Contact section more minimalistic and compact**, especially in desktop view.
    - Instead of large cards, show **icons (Email, LinkedIn, GitHub)** with subtle hover effects.
    - Ensure this layout is **responsive and centered** in both mobile and desktop views.
    - Icon links:
        - Email: `mailto:nigel.ong00@gmail.com`
        - LinkedIn: [`https://linkedin.com/in/niong`](https://linkedin.com/in/niong)
        - GitHub: [`https://github.com/nigel-ong`](https://github.com/nigel-ong)
    
    ---
    
    ## üìê Journey Section (Professional Timeline)
    
    - In **desktop mode**, the timeline line is currently centered ‚Äî **shift the vertical timeline line to the left side**.
    - Align all timeline content (jobs and education) on the **right side**, and allow it to take up **more horizontal space** for readability.
    - **In the mobile version** remove the vertical timeline line all together.
    
    ---
    
    ## üçî Mobile Menu Fixes
    
    - When opening the **hamburger menu**, the section links (About, Journey, Projects, etc.) are **transparent** and hard to see.
    - Add a **solid background** behind the dropdown (e.g., white or off-white for light mode, dark for dark mode make **opacity** 90%).
    - Keep the menu **lightweight and not full-screen** ‚Äî it should only cover the dropdown items, not the entire page.
    
    ---
    
    ## üí° Hover Effect Fixes
    
    - The **hover/mouse-follow effect currently only works in dark mode**.
    - Make it **work in light mode too**.
    - Reduce the **circle size to approximately 1/10th of the screen width** for a cleaner, subtler feel.
    
    ---
    
    ## Font Change: Use Inter
    
    - Replace the current `system-ui` font stack with **`Inter`** as the site‚Äôs global font.
    - Add the following Google Fonts import to the `<head>`:
    
    ```html
    html
    CopyEdit
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    
    ```
    
    - In the CSS:
    
    ```css
    css
    CopyEdit
    body {
      font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    }
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    - Change the **profile image** from a **circle** to a **square** with subtle rounded corners.
    - Ensure the shape remains consistent in **both desktop and mobile views**.
    
    ---
    
    Please make sure all updates:
    
    - Are responsive across devices
    - Work in both light and dark mode
    - Maintain consistent styling using my primary brand colors:
        - `#B7D3E9` (accent color)
        - `#F1D2E7` (subtle background or highlight)
        - when in light mode change any accent color from`#B7D3E9` to `567ACE`
