Hi Replit! Please help finalize and polish the site with the following **interactive, animated, and visual enhancements**. Also, ensure that all features are **clearly documented** so they can be adjusted easily in the future. This will be my last final request, MAKE SURE NOT TO CREATE A CHECKPOINT UNTIL ALL FEATURES ARE APPLIED

## 🧠 Core Enhancements

### 1. 🖱️ Shine & Shadow Hover Effects

- Apply the **shine animation** and **hover shadow effect** not only in dark mode, but also in **light mode**.
- Use `#567ACE` as the secondary accent in light mode, and `#F1D2E7` in dark mode.
- Apply to:
    - **Technical Skills cards**
    - Any other interactive card elements (e.g., Journey, Projects)
- ✅ After implementation, include:
    - How to change the color, speed, and shadow radius.
    - A way to apply these effects **automatically to new cards added in the future** (e.g., via a shared component or class).

### 2. 🎨 Subtle Background Layer / Depth

- Add a **subtle, low-contrast animated or textured background** to the site for visual depth.
- Options could include:
    - Light animated noise
    - Blurred abstract shapes
    - Subtle parallax layers
- ✅ Make sure:
    - It's not distracting
    - It works across all sections and themes
    - It's customizable via a single place (e.g., a class or theme config)

### 3. 🌐 Interactive Skill Visualization

- Create a **more dynamic technical skill visualization**:
    - Add hover interaction to display sub-skills or tooltips
    - Allow animation when skills load or scroll into view
- ✅ Ensure the layout gracefully supports future skills and keeps hover effects consistent.

### 4. 🧭 Page Transition Animations

- Implement **smooth transitions between sections/pages**:
    - Use fade, slide, or crossfade effects
    - Avoid abrupt changes when navigating or scrolling to anchors
- ✅ Let us adjust the duration/easing in a config or comment block.

### 5. 🐣 Fun Easter Egg Interaction

- Add a **playful hidden interaction** that reveals a **fun fact about Nigel**:
    - Triggered by a “secret” gesture or input (e.g., triple-click, Konami code, or tapping a hidden corner).
    - Display a message like:
        
        > “Fun fact: My favorite Pokemon is Dragonite!.”
        > 
- ✅ Document how to change the trigger and the fun fact message.

---

### 6. 📜 Scroll-triggered Animations

- Implement **scroll-based animations** for all major sections:
    - Fade-in, slide-up, zoom, or parallax
    - Should trigger once on scroll-in and not loop on every scroll
- ✅ Add fallback/no-animation version for accessibility.

---

## 📝 Post-Implementation Requirements

After all features are added:

- ✅ Add detailed inline comments where applicable
- ✅ Update `README.md` with a section titled:
    
    **"✨ Visual Effects & Interactivity Guide"**, covering:
    
    - How each animation/effect works
    - How to customize or disable them
    - Where to add new entries that inherit these behaviors automatically

Let me know if any animation library is used (e.g., `framer-motion`, `GSAP`, `AOS`) so I can maintain it properly later. Thanks!
